This is the first post of my new blog at [blog.ad-schmidt.de](https://blog.ad-schmidt.de). You probably already noticed that.

## Motivation
So how did this blog come to existance? I did some recent projects (building and programming a new keyboard, developping an android widget) and wanted to write about it. 
As I write these lines the android widget is still not finished, so it is also a means to keep me at it. So that I can finish this side project while also working on my main job.

## Tech stack
Without much research I knew, that I wanted to use a static site generator where I could write my posts in Markdown. So I stumbled upon [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and thought it is worth a try.

I then looked at all the available themes and chose the quite minimalistic [Hugo Bear Blog](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-bearblog/).

Thankfully there also was already a [guide](https://lab.uberspace.de/guide_hugo.html) how to install Hugo on my [Uberspace](https://uberspace.de/de/).
This was quite straightforward, so now I am here having my blog up and running just after a few hours.

Hopefully I will find some more time to customize the theme to my liking (adjusting colors and so on). However, I hope you will not find many posts for the [#hugo](/blog/hugo)-tag in this blog, as this would mean that I am doing more work on configuring the blog than filling it with content.

## Git
When using a static side generator and being a developer it is quite obvious to use git to store all the content, configuration, etc. so this is also what I did for this blog.
You can find the corresponding repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/schmidti159/blog.ad-schmidt.de).

Even as nobody knows of this blog (yet) I still wanted to have a test-environment to try new layouts or to publish my content to, before deploying it to the real page. So I also created a separate branch for the [pre-prod](https://pre-prod.blog.ad-schmidt.de) environment.

My desired workflow is to write content or play around with customizations in the pre-prod environment and only merge the changes to the main-branch once they are ready to go live.

## The minimalistic CI/CD pipeline
So having this setup with at least 2 branches I tried to come up with the simplest continous delivery pipeline:
* When I push a commit to the pre-prod branch it should be displayed at [pre-prod.blog.ad-schmidt.de](https://pre-prod.blog.ad-schmidt.de) immediately
* When I push a commit to the main branch it should be displayed at [blog.ad-schmidt.de](https://blog.ad-schmidt.de) immediately

### Basic setup
The combination of the default setup of an uberspace (having one directory for every subdomain) and the static site generator make it easy to write a small [script](https://github.com/schmidti159/blog.ad-schmidt.de/blob/pre-prod/deploy.sh) that can deploy the currently checked out content directly.

So now all that is left to be done when there is new commit is:
1. Do a git pull on my uberspace
2. Run the deploy script

The initial trigger for this could be a GitHub [webhook](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/about-webhooks), so I started reading up how those work.

### GitHub Webhooks
GitHub can send Webhooks for just about everything that happens in a repository. For my use case a simple hook for each push is enough.

This means, that I need to provide an endpoint at my web space to be called from GitHub, so I used another subdomain api.ad-schmidt.de and wrote a small flask-app to perform the necessary actions. 

Fortunately there is [guide](https://lab.uberspace.de/guide_flask.html) how to install flask on an uberspace. So this app checks the webhook payload, validates the secret and then pulls from github and executes the deploy-script.

You can have a look at this mini-api-application on [here](https://github.com/schmidti159/api.ad-schmidt.de)

## Summary
So now that everything is up and running I will continue to work on my small android widget and write about it here. Let's see what comes after that.
