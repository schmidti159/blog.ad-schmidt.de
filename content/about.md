# About

I am a father, hobbyist drummer and full stack software developer, living in Bamberg, Germany.

In my day job I am developing solutions for technical documenation with [DOCUFY](https://docufy.de) in Java and XSLT.

This blog however, is focussed around other hobby projects I do in my free time.

It is mainly meant to motivate me to finish these projects. Also I hope that some person that reads about the bugs/issues I had can learn from them the same way I did.
